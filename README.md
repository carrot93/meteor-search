Full-text search 

## How

### Step 1 - Get Lots of Data

#### Seed Content

When you boot this app it will access the Twitter Streaming API and fetch 
thousands of tweets for you to search through (*locally*).
(leave it running for a few minutes and you will get 10k posts. 
Or a few hours if you want hundreds of thousands to stress test search)
